# MY PROFILE
## Emma Dgreat Ehis Osagiede
Hey, My name is Emma but you can call me Sigma. I like pizza with pepperroni. like others I love coding, it is so always happy to get chances in wonderful meetings, I feel amazed when using GitHub and also Git. Even though most meetings seem boring coding pastes happiness In it! Some days are sad, some days are angry, but coding days are always happy! Not every meeting is about chatting. When people come and try to say bad in the chat I try my best to ignore them! Everyday something must be in the chat but I try to not write any word in there. I like ketchup, I like Jam with bread and also bananas!
I know I was meant to say about myself but I said the intro only and how much I love to be in meetings.

I like coding, I try my best to be good at technology, cause I know not everyone is good at it.
I like watching "Avacado_playz" and "AumSum", I know not everyone and body in the world must watch it but I like to watch them.
